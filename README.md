# task_5_test_evernote

This was my first experience with JS and Playwright. Initially, I conducted some research, 
tried out webdriver.io, and wrote some tests with it. Then I tried Playwright. 
I chose JS + Playwright because I believe it's a promising, new product with convenient reports, 
screenshots, and easy installation.

The code could have been made even more convenient and readable, that's how it will be at work.


I'll repeat myself again. I'd like to remind you that I mentioned in the interview that 
I did not know JS and had to learn it while completing tasks for you. The last time 
I tried Java was about 4-5 years ago, at my last place of work, in the penultimate project. 
I also tried Python, so I had to learn everything in order to complete the assignment for you.
