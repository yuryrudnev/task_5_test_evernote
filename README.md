# task_5_test_evernote

This was my first experience with JS and Playwright. Initially, I conducted some research, 
tried out webdriver.io, and wrote some tests with it. Then I tried Playwright. 
I chose JS + Playwright because I believe it's a promising, new product with convenient reports, 
screenshots, and easy installation.
